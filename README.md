## Flask Image Classification App with Checkpoint Weights

This Flask application provides a user interface for image classification using a pre-trained model with loaded checkpoint weights.

**Features:**

- Uploads an image.
- Performs image preprocessing (resizing, conversion, etc.).
- Makes predictions using a loaded Keras model.
- Displays the predicted class for the uploaded image.

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pillow (PIL Fork)
- NumPy

**Setup:**

1. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install flask tensorflow keras pillow numpy
   ```

2. Replace placeholders in the code:

   - `MODEL_PATH`: Path to your saved model architecture (`.h5` file).
   - `CHECKPOINT_PATH`: Path to your saved checkpoint weights (`.h5` file).
   - `TARGET_NAMES`: List of class names corresponding to your model's output (adjust accordingly).
   - In the `preprocess_image` function, adjust preprocessing steps if needed (e.g., normalization parameters).

3. Create an HTML template (`index.html`) for the user interface (form to upload image and display prediction).

**Usage:**

1. Save the code as `app.py`.
2. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser.
4. Upload an image and click submit.
5. The predicted class for the image will be displayed.

**Additional Notes:**

- This code demonstrates a basic example. You might need to adapt it to your specific model and requirements.
- Consider implementing error handling for invalid user inputs or unexpected errors.

**Deployment:**

For production deployment, consider using a web server like Gunicorn or deploying the app to a cloud platform.
